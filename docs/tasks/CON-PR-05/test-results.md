| `npm run test:golden` | 48/48 synthetic fixtures passed; no provider calls |
| `npx playwright test tests/e2e/con-pr-05-conversation-flow.spec.ts --project=desktop-chromium --project=mobile-chromium --workers=1 --reporter=line` | 6 passed, 0 failed |
| `npm run build` | Passed; Vite emitted the existing >500 kB chunk-size warning |
| `git diff --check` | Passed |

The browser suite uses deterministic API responses and the existing test-session fixture. It covers freeform input, generated contextual follow-up, 11 grounded recommendations, insufficient recommendation context without padded candidates, pending proposal and explicit approval, aggregate summary/source navigation, the mobile summary dialog, refresh persistence, typed number/range/rank controls, Requirements ready, and a persisted same-revision PRD `review_required` draft after route reload. Google OAuth is outside the requested browser scope. These fixtures verify the application flow, not live provider output.

## Full-suite result

`npm run test:unit` reported 349 passed and 1 failed. The failing test is `tests/unit/src-pr-01-source-upload-command.test.js` — “removes a source transactionally without replacing sibling records” — where `removeSourceAndReferences` reads `undefined.map`. The same targeted failure was reproduced on clean `main` at `df54aafa`; it is pre-existing and outside this PR's source/conversation changes.

Agent Browser is unavailable in the current environment; Playwright Chromium was used for the complete desktop and mobile flow. Live provider and Google OAuth behavior remain unverified by this validation.
